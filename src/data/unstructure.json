The engine, a single Mercedes D.III water-cooled in-line type of 160 horsepower - was mounted in the extreme forward portion of the fuselage with the distinct radiator \"horn\" protruding the top. The engine powered a two-blade wooden propeller. The forward portion of the fuselage was contoured to an extent, producing a somewhat aerodynamic look while the rest of the body maintained a boxy-like appearance. Seating was for two, made up of the pilot and an observer in tandem, with the pilot in the forward cockpit behind a simplistic windscreen. The pilot had access to a single Spandau machine gun offset to his right side. The system was synchronized to fire through the spinning propeller blades without damaging them via an interrupter gear. The observer manned the rear cockpit, facing aft, and sat inside of a Schneider-type gun mount ring. His position was dominated by a Parabellum machine gun with adequate traverse to engage trailing enemy fighters. The undercarriage remained fixed, characterized by the two large main landing gears at front and a simple tail skid under the tail section. The empennage featured a sharp-angled vertical tail fin with low-mounted horizontal stabilizers.\nPerformance was good for the time with the C.IV yielding a top speed of 98 miles per hour with a service ceiling of 16,404 feet. Endurance from the Mercedes engine was reported to be roughly 3 hours of flight time."

        "content": "The end of the D.I biplane fighter for AEG did not mark the end of work on the series. The design was evolved into a triplane form as the Dr.I. The triplane made its mark through several notable designs put forth by the Allies and the Germans and advantages included maximized control due to the increase in lift and drag. Such fighters held a short-lived mastery of the skies for designs ultimately reverted back to biplane types. Nevertheless, just about every major aircraft firm attempted a three-winged (or more) design before the end of the war.\nDevelopment of the Dr.I originated from a review of a captured British Sopwith Triplane fighter during July of 1917. This possessed the Germans to develop something of equal capability lest they be outdone in the air by their long-time enemy. In October of 1917, AEG attempted just that and took their ultimately-abandoned D.I biplane and added a third wing member between the existing upper and lower sections. The aircraft retained the fuselage, tail unit and armament suite (2 x 7.92mm machine guns) of the D.I as well as the wheeled tail-dragger undercarriage. Power was derived from a Daimler D.IIIa 6-cylinder water-cooled inline piston engine of 170 horsepower.\nDespite the third wing element, the Dr.I showcased poor handling  and the added drag reduced performance of an already poor-performing fighter (maximum speed was 106 miles per hour). As quickly as the Dr.I appeared, it was abandoned as no interest in the type had formed."

        "content":"The first Italian aircraft to break the speed of sound  under control - the \"Sagittario 2\" (\"Archer 2\") - actually held roots in an earlier piston-powered monoplane form. The S.7 was developed along the lines of a racing aircraft and first flew in July of 1939, prior to the formal start of World War 2 (1939-1945). This aircraft managed speeds near 370 miles per hour with its streamlined Alfa Romeo inline engine outputting 225 horsepower. About ten were taken on by Italy during the war and a further 145 were added in the post-war years.\nFrom this rather conventional beginning, the \"Sagittario\" was realized as a technology demonstrator. Only one vehicle was constructed and this carried a Turbomeca \"Marbore\" turbojet engine outputting 840 pounds thrust. The airframe stayed somewhat faithful to the original S.7 but changes were clearly made to accept the jet powerplant - these included swept-back wing mainplanes (45-degrees) and a nose-mounted intake. First flight of the Sagittario came on January 5th, 1953.\nWith this foundation in place, the prototype \"Sagittario \"2 was born and its design was attributed to Sergio Stefanutti. Construction of the aircraft was through Industrie Meccaniche Aeronautiche Meridionali (AERFER) with the intent on bringing the model along for the daytime interceptor role with a light attack function as secondary.\nEngineers were able to produce a most-compact jet aircraft. Power was from a Rolls-Royce \"Derwent 9\" turbojet engine outputting 3,600 pounds thrust and its aspiration came from a small circular nose intake. The single-seat cockpit was featured at midships under a largely unobstructed bubble-style canopy. Wings were swept rearwards for high-speed flight and the fuselage form was well-streamlined and left relatively featureless. The tail unit incorporated swept-back surfaces as well, made up of a single vertical tail fin and low-mounted horizontal planes (dihedral was noted on the latter). A tricycle undercarriage rounded out the list of features."

        "content": "The \"5th Generation Fighter\" - along with the \"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\" - is the current buzzword in the aviation defense industry. The 5th Generation fighter is a technological marvel, intended to surpass the capabilities of both modern 4th and 4.5th Generation mounts in wide circulation today through powerful tracking and engagement facilities, advanced avionics, high-end engine installations, agile performance, composite structures and inherent stealth features to help dominate the battlefield. The first operational 5th Generation Fighter design became the American Lockheed F-22 \"Raptor\" air superiority fighter which has been followed by developments emerging from Russia (Sukhoi Su-57 \"Felon\") and China (Chinese Chengdu J-20). India remains in a joint-development effort with the Russians fto produce a localized version of the Su-57, a Turkish endeavor has been announced, and a Japanese 5th Generation fighter design (born from the Mitsubishi ATD-X demonstrator) is advancing. As such, South Korea has followed suit and thrown its hat into the ring with its own local 5th Generation Fighter program - the \"KF-21 Boromae\" (formerly the \"KF-X\").\nThe Korean War (1950-1953) cost the lives of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel, becoming one of the major battlegrounds of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States (ahead of the Vietnam War). Prior to the war, and after World War 2 and the fall of the Japanese Empire, the Korean Peninsula was divided between a communist northern sphere and a democratic southern sphere. With Stalin's blessing, the North moved in to invade the South and the UN responded in force over the three-year conflict that saw the advent of the jet fighter and jet-versus-jet duels that eventually incorporated Soviet-versus-American pilots. The war ended with a loose armistice and tensions have been high and low ever since.\nThe South Korean KF-X fighter program seeks to design, develop and produce a wholly indigenous 5th Generation Fighter of the multirole type to create an imbalance of the playing field against the North. The North fields a collection of Soviet/Russian aircraft with a portion of its fleet dating back to the Cold War years. An indigenous initiative would seemingly provide the South Koreans with complete autonomy in the future aerial defense of their country and allow the option to export the system to interested allied parties for self-economical gain. However, indigenous 5th Generation Fighter programs are costly beasts and consume much research and development effort as they do time to implement in full (as proven by the bloated Lockheed F-35 program which initially promised several financial and logistical benefits). Despite the inherent benefits of such a program, there are obvious drawbacks to threaten the future of the KF-X. To date, several configurations have been studied with no clear concrete direction established as the future of the program remains in doubt. The South Korean Air Force may very well be forced to settle on existing fighter mounts - most likely 4.5th Generation Types - for the near future. The front-running designs of the KF-X program - like other current 5th Generation Fighter designs appearing globally - imitate the design lines established by the Lockheed F-22 Raptor utilizing low-observable features and inherent stealth benefits.©MilitaryFactory.com"

        "content": "The Lockheed F-35 \"Lightning II\" (unofficially nicknamed the \"Panther\") is a 5th Generation strike fighter development of the United States that incorporates new and learned stealth technology and practices with advanced computer processing and systems through a modular approach. The original project goal (it began as the \"Joint Strike Fighter\") was to develop a single airframe capable of serving the multiple armed services of the U.S. Department of Defense - namely the United States Air Force (through the 'F-35A'), the United States Navy (through the carrier-capable 'F-35C'), and the United States Marine Corps (through the VTOL-capable 'F-35B'). Other major global players emerged in the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy (RN)\nAs such, the F-35 program has produced three related yet distinct airframes to reflect respective operator uses with each offering centered around the same single-engine, single-seat approach. Despite differences between production models, the aircraft remains a supersonic (Mach 1.0+ capable) performer with inherently lethal strike capabilities unmatched by any other modern over-battlefield platform.\nDespite its appearance mimicking that of Lockheed's other fighter project, the F-22 'Raptor', the F035's role is primarily that of strike with air-to-air as secondary. The F-22 is billed as an air superiority fighter through-and-through. The F-35 will be called upon to undertake attack missions through the use of precision-guided drop bombs, conventional drop bombs, and air-launched missiles while also being capable of advanced airborne real-time reconnaissance and radar-suppression - all this while retaining air-to-air capabilities.

        "content": "The YF-23 Black Widow II was Northrop Grumman's (teamed with McDonnell Douglas Corporation) answer to the American ATF (Advanced Tactical Fighter) challenge proposed by the United States Air Force (USAF). The YF-23 competed unsuccessfully with the Lockheed / Boeing / General Dynamics offering - the YF-22 \"Lightning II\" - later adopted into service as the F-22 \"Raptor. The YF-23 ended its days as a museum showpiece and only two flyable prototypes were completed during the project run.\nThe curvy, low profile YF-23 was a stark contrast from the sharp edges of the YF-22 and featured a wide, almost pancake-like airframe structure with blended wing elements. The pilot sat within the forward section of the fuselage and given access to a completely digital, then-ultra-modern cockpit offering relatively excellent vision. Intakes, to aspirate the twin engine arrangement, were positioned along the underside of the fuselage. The twin tail fins were outward-canted and straddled the thrust-vectoring engine outlets. No horizontal tailplanes were featured.\nOne element of the development phase of the competition was to evaluate two experimental turbofan engines - the Pratt & Whitney YF119 and the General Electric YF120. As such, each YF-23 prototype was fitted with one set  of the available engines. The first prototype was designated \"PAV-1\" and carried YF119 engines and the second prototype - \"PAV-2\" - fitted YF120 engines. The YF119 eventually won out over the YF120 and went on to power the F-22 Raptor fighter in service.\nThe YF-23, with its thrust vectoring engines and Fly-by-Wire control scheme, proved itself a sound aircraft. It showcased the then-popular \"supercruise\" function which was a new concept of achieving sustained supersonic flight without the use of fuel-thirsty afterburner or any other form of specialized engine augmentation. This allowed the YF-23 to achieve impressive straight-line speeds while still retaining a stealth-like capability. Stealth was further enhanced by the YF-23's low profile as well as a classified make-up of the airframe concerning its skin material. It is said that this next-generation aircraft could avoid nearly 100% detection from most any radar system of the period."

The Su-57 is categorized as a \"Fifth Generation Fighter\" recognizing that it will make use of the latest aviation technology, radar-absorbing materials and weaponry to provide for excellent performance, agility and response for the unseen conflicts ahead. As a Fifth Generation fighter, the Su-57 is challenging the realm currently dominated by the American Lockheed F-22 \"Raptor\" air superiority fighter  - the world's first 5th gen fighter aircraft. The arrival of the T-50 introduces a second player to the once exclusive \"Fifth Generation Club\", owned wholly by the United States, while China continues development of their own indigenous 5th gen fighter across the Pacific.\nIn the Russian, \"PAK FA\" translates to \"Future Air Complex - Tactical Air Forces\". The Su-57 has been developed somewhat jointly through a partnership between Russia and India to which India has contributed as much as 35% to date. The Indian intent is to benefit from the program by procuring their own PAK FA-based 5th gen fighter in the coming decade. Serial production for the T-50 is slated for 2015 and the first public unveiling of the prototype was shown during the MAKS 2011 Air Show just outside of Moscow in August of 2011. Four prototypes has been completed to date (2013) with a fifth under construction. State trials are expected for 2014.\nIn the Russian inventory, the Su-57 will move in to take over the roles held by the large Sukhoi Su-27/Su-37 \"Flanker\" family as well as the lightweight Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" (all 4th Generation Fighters). Both of these lines have gone on to see much use in the global market resulting in a myriad of variants and configurations. The Su-57 will also move along the joint Russian-Indian FGFA (Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft) program for the near future - an agreement reached between the two nations in 2001 - with results expected to be introduced sometime in 2015. This aircraft and will be based highly on the developmental findings of the Russian PAK FA/T-50/Su-57 program with India intending to purchasing some 250 FGFA fighters at project's end. "

These were christened as ARA hercules (D1) and ARA Santisima Trinidad (D2). Both were ordered on May 18th, 1970 and acquired on June 16th, 1971 and October 11th, 1971, respectively. ARA Hercules (constructed by Vickers Shipbuilding Ltd of Barrow-in-Furness) was launched on October 24th, 1972 and taken into service on May 10th, 1976. Her formal commissioning took place on July 12th, 1976. Santisima followed on July 1st, 1981. Hercules was assigned to Puerto Belgrano Naval Base.\nARA Hercules was completed to the original Type 42 standard which made up most of the British Royal Navy's Type 42 fleet (a few were completed with lengthened hulls). After some time in service, her offensive capabilities were augmented by installation of the French-made MM-38 \"Exocet\" anti-ship missiles which forced a revision of some of her structure near the smoke funnel. She retained her 4.5\" turreted deck gun, a twin-launcher Sea Dart unit, 2 x 20mm Anti-Aircraft (AA) guns as well as 6 x 12.75\" (324mm) torpedo tubes. She also held onboard facilities for a single Westland Lynx (or similar) navy helicopter. Power was from a COmbined Gas And Gas (COGAG) arrangement involving 2 x TM-3B and 2 x RM-1A gas turbines driving 2 x shafts. She could hope to make headway at 28 knots in ideal conditions. Her crew complement numbered 280.\nFor the 1982 conflict with Britain, ARA Hercules joined ARA Santisima Trinidad as escorts to the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo aircraft carrier (detailed elsewhere on this site) but she faced mechanical issues which limited her participation. Very little action beyond tracking and fending off a British Sea Harrier was seen and Argentina went on to lose the war and control of the Falkland Islands for good."

The vessels - to number three - represent all-modern offerings of indigenous origins and re being constructed by the Hudong Zhonghua Shipbuilding Company of China. Their size and mission scope is comparable to the United State Navy's Wasp-class warships. Beyond the first Type 075 debuted on September 25th, 2019, the remaining two will arrive in 2020 and 2021 and all will be assigned to the Eastern Fleet.\nThe addition of a helicopter carrier considerably broadens China's tactical reach in amphibious-minded operations for the vessels provide a multi-pronged support approach which allows troops, vehicles (including waterborne fast-attack craft), and rotorcraft airpower to disembark and bring the fight to shore and beyond. This is particularly important considering the growing tensions with neighbors around the South China Sea - where Chinese forces already have a foothold through man-made islands and consistent power-projection sorties.\nAs completed, the Type 075 ships feature a running length of 250 meters, a beam measuring 30 meters, and a draught down to 8.5 meters. The latter quality is of note for this allows the ship to operate close-to-shore in supporting amphibious assault operations. Displacement reaches 40,000 ton under full load. The island superstructure is offset to the starboard side, leaving the center and port side unobstructed for rotorcraft operations. Powered hangar decks allow aircraft to be brought up or lowered  as needed. At the rear face of the hull is a loading area offering unfettered access to the sea by amphibious boats ready to take men and machine to shore."

This included the Type 997 Artisan 3D radar offering full situational awareness, navigational, and target indication capabilities and 1007 and 1008 radar sets as well as a UAT countermeasures suite.\nArmament was largely light and defensive in nature for her true role was always in support of her flight wing and amphibious operations. As such, armament was limited to 4 x 30mm DS30M Mk 2 series cannons, 3 x 20mm Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs), 4 x miniguns, and up to 8 x 7.62mm General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs). In this way, Ocean could counter incoming aircraft and missile threats as well as suicide boats attempting to reach her sides."

Endurance from the Mercedes engine was reported to be roughly 3 hours of flight time."

The type was primarily fielded as reconnaissance platform from 1916 onwards though it also served as a bomber escort and saw service with the German air service through to the end of World War 1in 1918. The C.IV represented one of AEG's most successful wartime ventures with production exceeding some estimated 658 examples. \n Outwardly, the C.IV was a conventional biplane through and through. The wings featured and equal span upper and lower wing assembly with double bays and parallel struts. The engine, a single Mercedes D.III water-cooled in-line type of 160 horsepower - was mounted in the extreme forward portion of the fuselage with the distinct radiator \"horn\" protruding the top. The engine powered a two-blade wooden propeller. The forward portion of the fuselage was contoured to an extent, producing a somewhat aerodynamic look while the rest of the body maintained a boxy-like appearance. Seating was for two, made up of the pilot and an observer in tandem, with the pilot in the forward cockpit behind a simplistic windscreen. The pilot had access to a single Spandau machine gun offset to his right side. The system was synchronized to fire through the spinning propeller blades without damaging them via an interrupter gear. The observer manned the rear cockpit, facing aft, and sat inside of a Schneider-type gun mount ring. His position was dominated by a Parabellum machine gun with adequate traverse to engage trailing enemy fighters.
